          I work at the intersection of community, systems, and AI. My focus is helping local businesses grow through better workflows, intentional experiences, and human-centered design — both online and offline.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">My Approach</h2>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-600">
          <p>
            Too often, small businesses are sold tools without strategy. They end up with a CRM they don't use, a website that doesn't convert, and marketing that feels disconnected from their actual community.
          </p>
          <p>
            I take a different approach. I start by understanding how your business actually works — your customer journey, your team's capacity, and your community relationships. Then I help you build systems that support real growth, not just busywork.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it's optimizing your website for local SEO, designing events that generate content and partnerships, or implementing AI tools that actually save time — everything I do is focused on making your business work smarter.
